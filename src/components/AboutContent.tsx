            <p>
                Lobsters is a computing-focused community centered around link aggregation and discussion, launched on July 3rd, 2012.
                The administrator is <a href="https://lobste.rs/~pushcx" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Peter Bhat Harkins</a> ("pushcx"), contact him or <a href="https://lobste.rs/moderators" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">another moderator</a> with any support issues.
                Lobsters was created by <a href="https://lobste.rs/~jcs" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">joshua stein</a> with careful design touches to encourage a healthy community:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>a <a href="#tagging" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">tagging</a> system to categorize and filter submissions,</li>
                <li>a user <a href="#invitations" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">invitation tree</a> to combat spam,</li>
                <li><a href="#flags" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">flag explanations</a> to curb punishing disagreement,</li>
                <li>a strong commitment to <a href="#transparency" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">transparency</a>,</li>
                <li>and <a href="#features" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">many more features</a> that have been added over the years.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="guidelines" className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Guidelines</h2>
            <p><strong>Climate</strong>: Lobsters is more of a garden party than a debate club. We're learning things we didn't know to be curious about and sharing what we've made. Disagreements are normal but fights are not; it's OK to make your point, share a resource, and <a href="https://xkcd.com/386" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">let someone be wrong</a>. Abuse and bigotry are unwelcome.</p>
            <p><strong>Topicality</strong>: Lobsters is focused pretty narrowly on computing; tags like <a href="https://lobste.rs/t/art" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">art</a> don't imply every piece of art is on-topic. Some rules of thumb for great stories to submit:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Will this improve the reader's next program?</li>
                <li>Will it deepen their understanding of their last program?</li>
                <li>Will it be more interesting in five or ten years?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some things that are off-topic here but popular on larger, similar sites: entrepreneurship, management, news about companies that employ a lot of programmers, investing, world events, anthropology, self-help, personal productivity systems, last-resort customer service requests via public shaming, "I wanted to see what this site's amazing users think about this off-topic thing", and defining the single morally correct economic and political system for the entire world when we can't even settle tabs vs. spaces.</p>
            <p><strong>Brigading</strong>: Lobsters is not to be used to whip up an outrage mob and direct them at targets, especially individuals and small projects. It always feels righteous at first and becomes an awful tool for abuse. For contentious topics, try to submit a link to an overviews rather than linking into a project's community spaces like issue trackers and mailing lists. There isn't a clear-cut line between this and discussing trends and advocating for improvements in the field, so expect frustrating judgement calls.</p>
            <p><strong>Self-promotion</strong>: It's great to have authors participate in the community, but not to exploit it as a write-only tool for product announcements or driving traffic to their work. As a rule of thumb, self-promo should be less than a quarter of one's stories and comments.</p>

            <h2 id="tagging" className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Tags</h2>
            <p>When links or stories are submitted, they must be tagged by the submitter from a list of predefined <a href="https://lobste.rs/tags" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">tags</a>. Users can choose to <a href="https://lobste.rs/filters" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">filter</a> out or subscribe to all submissions with particular tags (example: <a href="https://lobste.rs/t/programming.rss" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">programming.rss</a>) or combinations of tags (example: <a href="https://lobste.rs/t/programming,audio.rss" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">programming,audio.rss</a>). All users see all stories by default. The tagging system works this way for three reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It keeps the site on-topic by only allowing a predefined list of tags. These tags represent what most of the users of the site want to read, so content that does not fit into any of those categories should not be submitted. It also keeps stories organized and more easily searchable.</li>
                <li>It promotes discussion. On a site with separate forums, a Ruby programmer would probably subscribe to a Ruby forum, but not a Python one. When a link is posted to the Python forum, that Ruby programmer would probably never see it, even though they may have something useful to say about it (perhaps the link is about a Python library which does the same thing as a Ruby library which that Ruby programmer created). On this site, the link would get posted with a <a href="https://lobste.rs/t/python" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">python</a> tag and shown to everyone, encouraging the Ruby programmer to read and comment on it (unless that Ruby programmer disliked Python enough to <a href="https://lobste.rs/filters" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">filter</a> it out).</li>
                <li>It keeps the community coherent. Often stories contain discussion about more than one topic, yet on other sites they are confined to a single forum, so a story about a Python library that also has security implications would have to be submitted to either the Python forum or the security forum, and one of those audiences would miss out on the discussion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Creating new tags and retiring old tags is done by the community by submitting, discussing, and voting on <a href="https://lobste.rs/t/meta" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">meta</a>-tagged requests about them, and these events are <a href="https://lobste.rs/moderations?moderator=(All)&amp;what[tags]=tags" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">logged</a> (since 2018-04). To propose a tag, post a <a href="https://lobste.rs/t/meta" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">meta</a> thread with the name and description. Explain the scope, list existing stories that should have been tagged, make a case for why people would want to specifically filter it out, and justify the increased complexity for submitters and mods.</p>

            <h2 id="invitations" className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Invitation Tree</h2>
            <p>The full <a href="https://lobste.rs/users" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">user tree</a> is public and each user's profile shows who invited them. This provides some degree of accountability and helps identify voting rings.</p>
            <p>Invitations are used as a mechanism for spam-control, to slow registrations to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">pace we can acculturate</a> (more below) and to encourage users to be nice, not to make the Lobsters userbase an elite club. Users are considered "new" for their first 70 days, and their usernames appear <span className="text-green-500">in green</span>. New users can't send invites, submit links to domains we haven't seen submitted before, flag stories and comments, suggest edits to story titles and tags, resubmit links that have been seen before, or downvote comments. If you know someone on the site, ask them for an invitation. If you wrote or made something that would be on-topic, you can post it and ask for an invitation in the comments. Finally, if you can't find anyone you know in the invitation tree and didn't author something posted to the site, consider getting to know the community <a href="https://lobste.rs/chat" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">in the chat room</a>.</p>
            <p>There's no limit on how many invitations a user can send (though we might at some point, to manage <a href="https://lobste.rs/stats" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">growth</a>).</p>
            <p>There's also no official vetting process for new users, each user is responsible for the people they invite. If a user you invited is being a jerk, you're encouraged to talk to them. If they're a spammer, your ability to invite may be suspended.</p>

            <h2 id="privacy" className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Privacy</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. We do not require e-mail addresses to register and we do not use tracking cookies. We do log IP addresses for 30 days for administrative and security purposes. We do not sell or share your data with third parties. We do not use third-party analytics services. We do not run ads. Domains used for marketing analytics are banned and tracking parameters are removed from links (look for <code>utm_</code> in <a href="https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/blob/master/app/models/story.rb" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">story.rb</a>).</p>

            <h2 id="flags" className="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Flags</h2>
            <p>Users can flag stories and comments when there's a serious problem that needs moderator attention; two flags are needed to add the story or comment to the moderation queue. Users must reach 50 karma to flag. When flagging, users must select a reason for the flag. These reasons are public and shown on the flagged item. The reasons are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Off-topic</strong>: for stories and comments that are not about computing.</li>
                <li><strong>Me-too</strong>: for comments that add no value to the discussion.</li>
                <li><strong>Troll</strong>: for comments that are intentionally inflammatory.</li>
                <li><strong>Unkind</strong>: for comments that are personally offensive.</li>
                <li><strong>Spam</strong>: for stories and comments that are unsolicited advertising.</li>
                <li><strong>Broken Link</strong>: for stories with a broken link.</li>
                <li><strong>Already Posted</strong>: for stories that have already been posted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Less than 1% of stories or comments get flagged, and users are not automatically punished by flags. Users whose stories or comments are getting flagged significantly more often are strongly encouraged to talk to mods about what's not working. (Please don't use flagging to try to push down topics or people you don't like; click "hide" on the story and <a href="https://xkcd.com/386" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">move on</a> rather than clutter up the mod dashboard with false alarms.)</p>

                <li>Lobsters is hosted on three VPSs at DigitalOcean: a <code>s-4vcpu-8gb</code> for the web server, a <code>s-4vcpu-8gb</code> for the mariadb server, and a <code>s-1vcpu-1gb</code> for the IRC bot. DNS is hosted at DNSimple and we use restic for backups to b2. Our servers are provisioned/deployed with Hatchbox and our config is in our repo. Lobsters is cheap to run, so we don't take donations.</li>
                <li>There are weekly office hours streams live on Twitch. You can drop by to ask questions, have a query run, or kibitz about the site. There is an archive with transcripts available.</li>
                <li>Sponsor of the lobster emoji: In February 2018, Lobsters held a fundraiser to officially adopt the new lobster emoji in support of the Unicode Foundation.</li>
                <li>The name "Lobste.rs" is a cute domain hack without any deeper meaning. Six years after the site was created, the fans of a self-help guru named themselves after a dumb mistake he made about lobsters. This is an inconvenient coincidence and it would be great if they'd stop it.</li>
                <li>As a Rails app that's big enough to have real-world complexity but small enough to be easily read, our codebase has seen a few interesting uses:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>MIT researchers used access patterns in development of a new database.</li>
                    <li>University of Chicago researchers unethically experimented on maintainers with institutional complicity.</li>
                    <li>Shopify's Ruby performance team performance tested the YJIT compiler they contributed to MRI Ruby.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Please do reach out if you find a use for our code!</li>
                <li>We have a backup domain <code>lobsters.dev</code> in case of issues with our primary domain.</li>
                <li><strong>Stickers</strong> will be available again when someone finds a service that will print and ship 2" square vinyl stickers with a bleed &lt;= 1/16" (preferably full-bleed) directly to people who want them.</li>
                <li>If you prefer the article links or comment links to open a new tab instead of navigating in your current tab you can add a client-side script to do so. (Discussion) Or maybe you'd like to read conversations breadth-first?</li>
